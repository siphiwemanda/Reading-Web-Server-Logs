# Google IT Support Professional Certificate, IT Automation: It’s not that scary!


This script was written, to look through a system log file to produce the following results


What you’ll do
* Analyze data from a web server.
* Write Ruby scripts to help you analyze that data from the web server.

Use the data to answer the following questions:
* What IP host is responsible for the most queries?
* What URL is most popular on the Apache2 server?
* What IP address is responsible for the most queries for a given URL (/secret.html)?
* How many 404 errors were served?

I have also provided a Log file so that the code can be tested offline
